# Quantum-Portfolio-Optimization

QPO is a master thesis project aimed at investigating a potential use case of quantum optimization algorithm known as 'Quantum Annealing'
in the field of finance. The goal is to construct an engine for portfolio diversification task based on graph theory problem called
'maximum independent set problem'. The engine will utilize the power of a quantum computer and will then later be compared to 
a classical way of dealing with such excercises. It will then be analysed whether there is a potential for this emerging technology
for stock market related purposes.
